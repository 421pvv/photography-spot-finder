It is the sixth-largest park in the city, containing 843 acres (341 ha), and the most visited urban park in the United States, with an estimated 42 million visitors annually as of 2016. It is also one of the most filmed locations in the world.\r\n\r\nThe park's main attractions include the Ramble and Lake, Hallett Nature Sanctuary, the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Reservoir, and Sheep Meadow; amusement attractions such as Wollman Rink, Central Park Carousel, and the Central Park Zoo; formal spaces such as the Central Park Mall and Bethesda Terrace; and the Delacorte Theater. The biologically diverse ecosystem has several hundred species of flora and fauna. Recreational activities include carriage-horse and bicycle tours, bicycling, sports facilities, and concerts and events such as Shakespeare in the Park. Central Park is traversed by a system of roads and walkways and is served by public transportation.\r\n\r\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Park","accessibility":"Central Park incorporates a system of pedestrian walkways, scenic drives, bridle paths, and transverse roads to aid traffic circulation, and it is easily accessible via several subway stations and bus routes. The park is pubic and is open to everyone!\r\n\r\nThe New York City Subway's IND Eighth Avenue Line (A, ​B, ​C, and ​D trains) runs along the western edge of the park. Most of the Eighth Avenue Line stations on Central Park West serve only the local B and ​C trains, while the 59th Street–Columbus Circle station is additionally served by the express A and ​D trains and the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line (1 train). The IRT Lenox Avenue Line (2 and ​3 trains) has a station at Central Park North. From there the line curves southwest under the park and heads west under 104th Street. On the southeastern corner of the park, the BMT Broadway Line (N, ​R, and ​W trains) has a station at Fifth Avenue and 59th Street.[474] The 63rd Street lines (F, <F>​, and Q trains) pass underneath without stopping,[474] and the line contains a single ventilation shaft within the park, west of Fifth Avenue and 63rd Street.[277]\r\n\r\nVarious bus routes pass through Central Park or stop along its boundaries. The M10 bus stops along Central Park West, while the M5 and part of the M7 runs along Central Park South, and the M2, M3 and M4 run along Central Park North. The M1, M2, M3, and M4 run southbound along Fifth Avenue with corresponding northbound bus service on Madison Avenue. The M66, M72, M79 SBS (Select Bus Service), M86 SBS, M96 and M106 buses use the transverse roads across Central Park. The M12, M20 and M104 only serve Columbus Circle on the south end of the park, and the M31 and M57 run on 57th Street two blocks from the park's south end but do not stop on the boundaries of the park.[473]\r\n\r\nSome of the buses running on the edge of Central Park replaced former streetcar routes that formerly traveled across Manhattan. These streetcar routes included the Sixth Avenue line, which became the M5 bus, and the Eighth Avenue line, which became the M10.[475] Only one streetcar line traversed Central Park: the 86th Street Crosstown Line, the predecessor to the M86 bus.[476]\r\n\r\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Park","bestTimes":["sunset","spring","fall","weekdays"],"images":[{"public_id":"qtiodyuae6a3xds1kven","url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/db7w46lyt/image/upload/v1731864044/qtiodyuae6a3xds1kven.jpg"},{"public_id":"nlscirvpuwxlfwyh1ki2","url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/db7w46lyt/image/upload/v1731864068/nlscirvpuwxlfwyh1ki2.jpg"},{"public_id":"uz3pcd1nkw1iufvpzdib","url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/db7w46lyt/image/upload/v1731864193/uz3pcd1nkw1iufvpzdib.jpg"}],"tags":["nyc","park","public","outdoors","tourist spot"],"posterId":{"$oid":"507f191e810c19729de860ea"},"createdAt":{"$date":"2024-11-17T17:23:26.259Z"},"reportCount":0,"averageRating":8.8,"totalRatings":1}]
